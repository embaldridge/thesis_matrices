# Introduction

Many ecological patterns are scale dependant

    Determining the scale over which a pattern is observed can inform:

        When it is appropriate to use a pattern for prediction

        Can infer what processes could be operating

Introduction of the nested subset pattern

Nested subset pattern and scale dependence

    Conceptual model developed by Patterson and Brown:

        Links pattern to process

        Assumes that the nested subset pattern is scale dependant.

Has been little work done on testing whether the nested subset pattern is scale dependant

Processes proposed to produce the nested subset pattern

    Ordered (deterministic) extinction/ colonization

        Expected to operate only at local and regional scales

        Unordered (stochastic) extinction/ colonization operates at all scales

    The other ones.

    Add the really nice passive sampling paragraph back in.

Hypothesis:  Based on the conceptual model of Patterson and Brown, the nested subset pattern should show scale dependence, such that we observe nestedness at the local and regional scales, but not at a continental scale.  

    Explain expectation

This type of scale dependence would suggest that the assumptions of the model, similar environmental conditions and a single species pool are necessary to observe nestedness.

# Methods

Tighten this up by explaining sampling regime better, and leaving out some of the philosophical null model bits, add graph showing dependence on metric with scale, and explain how we corrected for that.

# Results

Start introducing idea that our results were counter to our expectations

# Discussion

We observed that the nested subset pattern did not appear to be scale dependant, counter to our expectations.

Conceptual model does not appear to be supported, given that we do not observe the implied scale dependence.

Keep most of the discussion, I think, with maybe a bit more on how scale invariance of the pattern can point us to what potential processes might be operating.
